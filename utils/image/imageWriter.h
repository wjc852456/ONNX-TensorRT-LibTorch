/**
 * Save an image or set of images to disk.
 *
 * Supported image formats for saving are JPG, PNG, TGA, and BMP. Internally, 
 * imageLoader uses the saveImage() function to save the images, so the 
 * supported formats are the same.
 *
 * imageWriter has the ability to write a sequence of images to a directory,
 * for example `images/%i.jpg` (where `%i` becomes the image number), or 
 * just a single image with a static filename (e.g. `images/my_image.jpg`).
 * When given just the path of a directory as output, it will default to
 * incremental `%i.jpg` sequencing and save in JPG format.
 *
 * @note imageWriter implements the videoOutput interface and is intended to
 * be used through that as opposed to directly.  videoOutput implements
 * additional command-line parsing of videoOptions to construct instances.
 *
 * @see videoOutput
 * @ingroup image
