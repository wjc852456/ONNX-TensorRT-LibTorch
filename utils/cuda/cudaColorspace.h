/**
 * Convert between two image formats using the GPU.
 *
 * This function supports various conversions between RGB/RGBA, BGR/BGRA, Bayer, grayscale, and YUV.
 * In addition to converting between the previously listed colorspaces, you can also change the 
 * number of channels or data format (for example, `IMAGE_RGB8` to `IMAGE_RGBA32F`).
 *
 * For the list of image formats available, @see imageFormat enum.
 *
 * Limitations and unsupported conversions include:
 *
 *     - The YUV formats don't support BGR/BGRA or grayscale (RGB/RGBA only)
 *     - YUV NV12, YUYV, YVYU, and UYVY can only be converted to RGB/RGBA (not from)
 *     - Bayer formats can only be converted to RGB8 (`uchar3`) and RGBA8 (`uchar4`)
 *
 * @param input CUDA device pointer to the input image
 * @param inputFormat format enum of the input image
 * @param output CUDA device pointer to the input image
 * @param outputFormat format enum of the output image
 * @param width width of the input and output images (in pixels)
 * @param height height of the input and output images (in pixels)
 * @param pixel_range for floating-point to 8-bit conversions, specifies the range of pixel intensities
 *                    in the input image that get normalized to `[0,255]`.  The default input range is
 *                    `[0,255]`, and as such no normalization occurs.  Other common pixel ranges include
 *                    `[0,1]` and `[-1,1]`, and these pixel values would be re-scaled for `[0,255]` output.
 *                    Note that this parameter is only used for float-to-uchar conversions where the data
 *                    is downcast (for example, `IMAGE_RGB32F` to `IMAGE_RGB8`).
